# Facade

> Provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a large and sophisticated system body of code.

## Summary

- Build a Facade to provide a simplified API over a set of classes.
- My wish to (optionally) expose internals through a Facade.
- May allow users to 'escalate' to use more complex APIs if the need to.
