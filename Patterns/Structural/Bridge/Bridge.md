# Bridge

> Connecting components together through abstractions.

A mechanism that decouples an interface (hierarchy) from a implementation (implementation hierarchy).

## Summary

- Decouple abstraction from implementation.
- both can exist as hierarchies.
- A stronger form of encapsulation.
