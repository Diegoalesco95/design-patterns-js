# Composite

> A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Summary

- Objects can use other objects via inheritance, composition.
- Some composed and singular objects need similar/identical behaviors.
- Composite desgin let us treat both types of objects uniformly.
- Javascript supports iteration with Symbol.iterator.
- A single object can make itself iterable by yielding this.
