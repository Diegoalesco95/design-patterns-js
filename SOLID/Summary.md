# Sumary

## Single Responsability Principle

-   A class should only have one reason to change.
-   _Separation of concerns_ - different classes handling different, independent task/problems.

## Open-Closed Principle

-   Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

-   You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype

## Interface Segregation Principle

-   Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces.
-   _YAGNI_ - You Ain't Goint to Need it.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

-   High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions.
